<h1>About us</h1>

<p>Hi. I'm Kate and La Meva Casa is my baby and my passion.  It started with a corner in my garage and an idea.   Any one that knows me laughs at the idea of me selling gifts, collectables and decor.  My home is country meets modern industrial meets something that isn't even named!  My eclectic style is represented in the products we sell from the practical canisters and placemats to the weird Gold Ceramic Pineapples. </p>
<p>Now out of the garage and in our own office my hubby and my rock has  joined. La Meva Casa.   He is everything I am not.  Practical, organised and not impulsive!   He brings to La Meva Casa his years of involvement in management and logistics helping to keep everything running smoothly. </p>
<p>We also have our first employee Jaz, our wonderful, eye twitching organiser and postage girl.   She wraps and packs and sends the oddest things all over Australia from the poly resin lamb to Tasmania to the huge metal Tree of Life to Karratha in WA.   In fact i buy odd size things just to give Jaz a challenge and Jaz always rises to the challenge. </p>
<p>So together we form La Meva Casa.   We pride ourselves on our exceptional customer service while delivering products that are affordable without compromising on quality or style. </p>
<p>So join us on this journey we take and make La Meva Casa - Your Home - for gifts and collectables.  (And everything in between)!<br />
